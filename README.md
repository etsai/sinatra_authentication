#### ToDo
A user can SignOut using the provided delete route which is invoked via AJAX.

Additional Stretch
- Add validation to the user model including password length and appropriately formated email.
- Display appropriate error messages to the user for invalid data.
- Add a field to store user access level (Admin / Student) and limit functionality to different users leves. (ie an Admin can edit users but a Student can only see other users).
